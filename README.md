Bus-mall project

Displays sets of 2 or more (currently 3) different pictures side by side for the user to vote (click) on one of them.

Once the total number of sets (currently 25 rounds) has been displayed and voted, the user may click on a button to see the number of times a picture was shown and the number of votes it got on a chart and on a list.

Persistent (local) storage allows it to display cummulative results.

*A button to allow the user to reset cummulative results (i.e. clear local storage) would be a good feature*
